First ans important, just to clarify, I am not the author of this program. 

Background:
	GICL/TICL is such a good program to cluster, overlap and extend large set of ESTs. It seems this program is no longer well-maintained, And it's said difficult to setup. And some recent versions of PERL report error. 
	SO, so, so I decided to rewrite the main program to make it run perfectly.
	I believe that would benefit many people, who were or are struggling with EST overlapping problems
	Just to be sure, I did not rewrite those core-algorithm-related executables. So, 
		
Description:
	Here is an new repository for GICL, I rewrite some of the perl code to make this program to run with recent perl versions

To do list:
	Later I will write a detailed protocol to show "HOW-TO setup this program".
		How to compile from source
		How to setup step by step
